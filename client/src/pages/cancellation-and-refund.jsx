          <strong>RAHUL SINGH</strong> believes in helping its customers as far
          as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under
          this policy:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within
            1-2 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may
            not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
            vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>RAHUL SINGH</strong> does not accept cancellation requests
            for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
            refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
            quality of product delivered is not good.

          <li>
            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the
